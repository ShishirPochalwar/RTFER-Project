The dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the closure of physical classrooms and teaching methods being shifted to the online medium. 
So, to overcome the challenges of COVID-19 Pandemic  ‘Distance learning or E-learning’ became the trend in Learning. 
To make the online learning environment more interactive, just like traditional offline classrooms, it is essential to ensure the proper engagement of students during online learning sessions. 
Here Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition System in Learning Engagement plays an important role.

In this project, I have proposed how real time facial emotion recognition system works using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).
There are various datasets of facial emotion like FER-2013, CK+, and RAF-DB but in this project we are using FER-2013 Dataset. 
We can also use various CNN and Deep Neural Network(DNN) algorithms like Inception-V3, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and RCNN. 
There are 7 types of emotions in it namely happy, sad, fearful, surprised, angry, neutral, and disgust which I’ve divided into 2 parts “Engaged” and “Disengaged”.
